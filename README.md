# FreeCodeCamp

I have decided to take the 100 Days of Coding Challenge. This repository is meant to document my progress.

To explain my situation -- I currently have two systems administration and support jobs. One is purely hinged on the Microsoft platform -- Office 365, SharePoint Online, and Azure. The other job involves managing a ~90 server Freeswitch infrastructure based on the Debian distro. 

If you think my jobs -- and my background -- have no relation to web development coding at all, you are right. But I have coded before, and yearn to do so again. I have several projects in mind, and I need to gain the skills to build them.
